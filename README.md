The **Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing** project leverages machine learning to anticipate equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules in industrial settings. By analyzing sensor data such as temperature, pressure, vibration, and operational cycles, the project trains classification models—like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost—to predict whether a machine is likely to fail. It includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Developed in Python using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, the project demonstrates how predictive analytics can minimize unplanned downtime, extend machinery life, and improve overall operational efficiency. This solution is well-suited for manufacturers aiming to transition from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies using data-driven insights.
